This directory contains the program entry point, thread management, and
control functions.

* The main / foreground thread services control inputs from signals, the
  command line shell (if enabled), etc.

* The packet / background threads service one input source apiece.

The main_loop() starts a new Pig when a new source (interface or pcap,
etc.) is available if the number of running Pigs is less than configured.

It also does housekeeping functions like servicing signal flags, shell
commands, etc.

The shell has to be explicitly enabled at build time to be available and
then must be configured at run time to be activated. Multiple simultaneous
remote shells are supported.

Unit test and piglet test harness build options also impact actual
execution.

Reload is implemented by swapping a thread local config pointer by each
running Pig.  The inspector manager is called to empty trash if the main
loop is not otherwise busy.
