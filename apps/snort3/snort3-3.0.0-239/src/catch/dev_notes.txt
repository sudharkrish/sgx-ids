=== Unit Test

This directory contains the unit-test interface.

catch.hpp is from https://github.com/philsquared/Catch.

If a source file contains only Catch unit tests, the linker must be tricked
into not excluding the seemingly unneeded object file.  To do this, include
unit_test.h in the source file and add this directive to the beginning of the
source code:
    SNORT_CATCH_FORCED_INCLUSION_DEFINITION(source_file_name_less_extension)
Additionally, edit unit_test_main.h to add the external definition with:
    SNORT_CATCH_FORCED_INCLUSION_EXTERN(source_file_name_less_extension)
As well as the reference to it in catch_extern_tests[] with:
    SNORT_CATCH_FORCED_INCLUSION_SYMBOL(source_file_name_less_extension)
