This directory contains all files related to IP Reputation inspection.

Reputation inspector provides basic IP blacklist/whitelist capabilities, to
block/drop/pass traffic from IP addresses listed. In the past, we use standard
Snort rules to implement Reputation-based IP blocking. This inspector will
address the performance issue and make the IP reputation management easier.
